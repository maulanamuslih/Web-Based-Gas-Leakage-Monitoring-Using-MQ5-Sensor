# Realtime Web Based Gas Leakage Monitoring Using MQ5 Sensor
This project aims to prototype a gas leak monitoring system using MQ5 sensors capable of detecting LPG, natural gas, and city gas. The data will be sent via WiFi and managed using MySQL as the main database. Apache will be used as a web service to display a pre-designed website hosted on a local server using a laptop.
