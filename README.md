# Web-Based Gas Leakage Monitoring Using MQ5 Sensor
This project aims to prototype a real-time gas leak monitoring system using MQ5 sensors capable of detecting LPG, natural gas, and city gas. The data will be sent via WiFi and managed using MySQL as the main database. **XAMPP** will streamline the development process by providing an integrated software package that includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Apache will be the web service that hosts and displays a pre-designed website on a local server using a laptop, ensuring real-time monitoring and updates.
